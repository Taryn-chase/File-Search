If wanting to search through an array (Option 1 when running script)
    
    Add the values you'd like to search in the Array.txt file
    1 Line per search value

    Search
    should
    look
    like
    this

    Be as exact as possible as if you are searching for a number it will return any number if it was within a string. (ex 9888 would return 1009888 if it appeared in the file)

If single value search (Option 2 when running script)
  
    It will prompt you to type in the value
    Type what you are searching for
    It will then ask if you have another value to search for
    If you don't type  'exit' to quit and return results
